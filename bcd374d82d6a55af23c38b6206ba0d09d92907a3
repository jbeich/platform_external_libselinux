      "message": "This is kind-of tricky to follow, if the open fails AND the load_map fails it falls below this and exits on the no valid fp check. If the open fails and the mmap succeeds were done and goto out, if the open succeeds and the mmap fails, we faill through the not fp check and process. What happens if they both succeed?",

      "message": "If the open of the text file succeeds and load_mmap() succeeds, we still goto out and just close the text file without any further processing of it.  The only reason we open + stat it first is to have the sb.st_mtime for comparison in load_mmap() to verify that the file_contexts.bin file is not stale/older than the file_contexts file.",
