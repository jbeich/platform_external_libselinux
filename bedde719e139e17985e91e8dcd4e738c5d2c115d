      "message": "Do we want to check also for SELINUXFS as well as CGROUP and DEVPTS? If we roll the sysfs check into this, we want SELINUXFS as well since its under sysfs. This would have the side-effect of labeling a filesystem that is present under sysfs that is not one of these types which is correct behavior for say an ext4 mount which currently would get skipped. As to why someone would mount something like ext4 under sysfs is beyond me.",
