Otherwise if init ever loads a policy from /data, it will continue loading policy from /data even if /data/security/current/selinux_version changes or is removed.\n\nAlso, we either need to validate the existence and readability (e.g. access(path, R_OK) for each of the policy file paths) of all of the /data policy files in this function or we need to still provide a fallback in the functions that open the policy files so that we won\u0027t fallover completely if for some reason we have a selinux_version without the policy files present or we have an incomplete set of policy files.",
