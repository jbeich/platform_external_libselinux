      "message": "This could yield a change in behavior.\nCurrently, we are using this to decide whether to check for a partial match and prune the tree walk early if there is no possible match for anything under a given directory as an optimization during the restorecon_recursive(\"/sys\").  So, for example, if there are no /sys/kernel/debug entries in file_contexts, then it will skip over the children of /sys/kernel/debug entirely.  As long as we only call it with restorecon_recursive(\"/sys\"), this won\u0027t affect anything as the statfs is done on the top level directory.  But if someone did a restorecon -R /sys/kernel/debug before and after this change, the old logic would have skipped its children while the new logic would walk the entire tree.",
