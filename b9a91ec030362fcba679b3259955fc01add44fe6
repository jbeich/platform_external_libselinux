      "message": "Logic change.   Previously we would only call compile_regex() up front if rec-\u003evalidating, and would always report an error if it failed.  I understand you are changing this because sefcontext_compile needs to compile the regex always (vs label_file, which defers compiling to first use unless validating on open), but perhaps you ought to set rec-\u003evalidating in sefcontext_compile instead.  That however will also enable context validation, so you might need to override/set the selinux_validate callback to a function that just always succeeds.",
