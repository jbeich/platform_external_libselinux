      "message": "Logic change.   Previously we would only call compile_regex() up front if rec-\u003evalidating, and would always report an error if it failed.  I understand you are changing this because sefcontext_compile needs to compile the regex always (vs label_file, which defers compiling to first use unless validating on open), but perhaps you ought to set rec-\u003evalidating in sefcontext_compile instead.  That however will also enable context validation, so you might need to override/set the selinux_validate callback to a function that just always succeeds.",

      "message": "I did test the option of setting rec-\u003evalidating \u003d 1 to get around changing this but as sefcontext_compile does not have a view of the policy to check against, it always displayed the fail messages as it used the current host policy to validate against. I guess to resolve this sefcontext_compile should have an option pointing to the policy - do you know if there is a way around this (could alway set selinux_log to output to dev/null but yuk)\n\nAnd also the -o option you mentioned for sepolicy Android.mk",

      "message": "Why can\u0027t you just override selinux_validate callback with a function that does nothing like I suggested above?\nOr, alternatively, change process_line() to take an additional bool argument that enables regex compilation without validation of the contexts.\nI also noticed that apparently at some point we changed these errors from fatal errors to warnings, even with rec-\u003evalidating, which seems odd to me.  I guess setfiles -c or checkfc in Android will still fail if there is an invalid context because they define their own SELINUX_CB_VALIDATE callbacks, but I would have expected label_file.c to treat not only context validation but also regex and type/mode errors as fatal at least when rec-\u003evalidating is set if not always.
