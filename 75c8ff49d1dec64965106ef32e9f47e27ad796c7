      "message": "Perhaps not in Android, but definitely in Linux distributions.  Cases where it falls back:\n- file_contexts.bin does not exist,\n- file_contexts.bin file is older than the file_contexts file, \n- file_contexts.bin format version is unknown to libselinux (i.e. generated by a sefcontext_compile built against a newer libselinux than the one on the system),\n- pcre version mismatch, i.e. file_contexts.bin was generated by a sefcontext_compile built against a different pcre library version than the one on the system,\n- any kind of parsing error or memory allocation failure during load.\n\nIn Linux distributions, file_contexts.bin is generated from file_contexts at runtime on the target system when policy is installed, so they could diverge and there is potential for a pcre library update separate from policy update, so these are real scenarios there.",
