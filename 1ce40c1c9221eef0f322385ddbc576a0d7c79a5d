Would require moving setprop selinux.reload_policy reload 1 from post-fs-data to boot or directly reloading right after property_service_init in the init code, and would mean that restorecon_recursive /data either needs to also be moved or will only ever work for the /file_contexts file, not any /data/security/file_contexts file.",
