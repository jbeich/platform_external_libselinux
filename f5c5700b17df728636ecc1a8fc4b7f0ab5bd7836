      "message": "regex_version keeps ownership of the version string buffer. It is never freed, alright. But that does not make it a memory leak because the amount of memory allocated is constant. The patch however creates a potential \"use after free\" condition which is dangerous. I know this looks  hacky. I wrote it to harmonize the version string retrieval of pcre and pcre2. I lament that it is not thread save and that there is a heap buffer that is not explicitly cleaned up. So I welcome a  better solution, but this is not it.",
