      "message": "regex_version keeps ownership of the version string buffer. It is never freed, alright. But that does not make it a memory leak because the amount of memory allocated is constant. The patch however creates a potential \"use after free\" condition which is dangerous. I know this looks  hacky. I wrote it to harmonize the version string retrieval of pcre and pcre2. I lament that it is not thread save and that there is a heap buffer that is not explicitly cleaned up. So I welcome a  better solution, but this is not it.",

      "message": "You could change semantics to return ownership to the caller in both cases (not only for PCRE). I decided against it because it would mean that the caller has to call free explicitly, which in turn, is prone to memory leak. This is at the cost of a single lingering buffer.\n\nA fix for the raciness of the PCRE2 case could be to factor out the initialization into a function. I think this guaranties that it is done only once. Like so: static char * version_sting \u003d initialize_pcre2_version_string();",
