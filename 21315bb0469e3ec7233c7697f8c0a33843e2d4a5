      "message": "I don\u0027t think you can use this one-time initialization approach for this file, as it won\u0027t be refreshed for updates at runtime (managed profile creation w/o reboot) and installd isn\u0027t restarted for each package install.  packages.list differs in that it is only used by installd/libselinux for restorecon_data during initialization, not for new package install, and we moved the invocation of the restorecon_data calls after packages.list has been updated by the PMS IIRC.  You would either need to load it and free it each time, or provide a reload interface similar to seapp_context_reload() and have UMS tell installd when to reload via a new socket command triggered after each update.",
